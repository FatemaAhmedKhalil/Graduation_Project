# Smart Railway System
In This Project, we designed A smart Railway system that uses smart IoT Technology.

This branch in this Repository includes the main code runs by the Raspberry Pi to control the whole project.

the Raspberry Pi takes messages from the STM32 at every cart by SPI communication protocol and sends the data to the server to show the state of every cart which is done by the help of all sensors and devices in the embedded branch.
