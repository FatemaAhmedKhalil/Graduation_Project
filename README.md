# Smart Railway System
In This Project, we designed A smart Railway system that uses smart IoT Technology Developed by us, for both the upper level Software and the low level software and hardware.
This project will be meaningless without the train itself, and to improve travelers’ satisfaction on their trip, the train cart will include some smart features such as 
1)	Smart Doors that automatically opens when it’s in front of the station platform and the train is stopping.	
2)	PIR Sensors to detect whether or not people are inside the cart, which will make it able to smartly turn off the lights when no one in the train cart.
3)	Flame sensor that quickly detects fire in order to sound the alarm to the train operators and other stations.
4)	Temperature and Humidity sensors to collect the readings and send the data to the controller in order to control the air quality using the air conditioners, which will save energy especially for a system that may not be connected to the grid.
